# dungeon_generator
Example dungeon generator for Goldsmiths MScCGE tools and middleware project.

This project in based on the version, provided by Andy Thomasson: https://github.com/andy-thomason/dungeon_generator

The dungeon is built, using corridors, rooms, intersections and corridor-stairs. Every tile is picked randomly, with weighted coefficients.

The main algorithm, on which I focused is the tile substitution.
